<h1>History</h1>
  <p>
  Until the 16th century, the drink from the Central and South American peoples was unknown to Europeans.<br/>

Christopher Columbus encountered the cacao bean on his fourth mission to the Americas on August 15, 1502, when he and his crew
seized a large native canoe that proved to contain among other goods for trade cacao beans. His son Ferdinand commented that the 
natives greatly valued the beans, which he termed almonds, "for when they were brought on board ship together with their goods,
I observed that when any of these almonds fell, they all stooped to pick it up, as if an eye had fallen." But while Columbus took
cacao beans with him back to Spain, it made no impact until Spanish friars introduced chocolate to the Spanish court.
<br/>
Spanish coquistador Hernán Cortés may have been the first European to encounter chocolate when he observed it in the court of 
Montezuma in 1519.<br/>
In 1568, Bernal Diaz, who accompanied Cortés in the conquest of Mexico, wrote of this encounter which he witnessed:

    From time to time they served him [Montezuma] in cups of pure gold a certain drink made from cacao. It was said that it gave
    one power over women, but this I never saw. I did see them bring in more than fifty large pitchers of cacao with froth in it, 
    and he drank some of it, the women serving with great reverence.<br/>

Jose de Acosta, a Spanish Jesuit missionary who lived in Peru and then Mexico in the later 16th century, described its use more
generally:

    Loathsome to such as are not acquainted with it, having a scum or froth that is very unpleasant taste. Yet it is a drink very
    much esteemed among the Indians, where with they feast noble men who pass through their country. The Spaniards, both men and
    women that are accustomed to the country are very greedy of this Chocolate. They say they make diverse sorts of it, some hot,
    some cold, and some temperate, and put therein much of that "chili"; yea, they make paste thereof, the which they say is good
    for the stomach and against the catarrh.<br/>

After the Spanish conquest of the Aztecs, chocolate was imported to Europe. There, it quickly became a court favorite. It was 
still served as a beverage, but the Spanish added sugar or honey to counteract the natural bitterness. Within about a hundred 
years, chocolate established a foothold throughout Europe.<br/>

How the word "chocolate" came into Spanish is not certain. The authority on the Spanish language, the Royal Spanish Academy, 
derives it from the Nahuatl word "xocolatl" (pronounced [ ʃoˈkolaːtɬ]) made up from the words "xococ" meaning sour or bitter,
and "atl" meaning water or drink. However, as William Bright noted the word "chocolatl" doesn't occur in central Mexican
colonial sources making this an unlikely derivation. Santamaria[16] gives a derivation from the Yucatec Maya word "chokol"
meaning hot, and the Nahuatl "atl" meaning water. More recently Dakin and Wichman derive it from another Nahuatl
term, "chicolatl" from Eastern Nahuatl meaning "beaten drink". They derive this term from the word for the frothing stick, 
"chicoli". The word xocoatl means beverage of maize. The words "cacaua atl" mean drink of cacao. The word "xocolatl"
does not appear in Molina's dictionary</p>
